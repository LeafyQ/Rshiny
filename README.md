# Rshiny
Doing data analysis and data visualization using R Shiny. Currently working on weekly data exercises using [Makeover Monday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).

( TODO:

[24 DS project to try](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/)

)

### Tools
- [Geograph](#geo)


### Projects
- [Data Visualization 101: using Rshiny and `ggplot2`](#demo)
- [R&D cost for different countries, differen years](#R&D)

## Tools
<a id='geo'></a>
### Making Geographic plot
1. Static plot in `ggplot2`

2. Daynamic plot in `leaflet`
`plotly` is not the optimal choice to do dynamic geographic information presenting, instead, we use `leaflet` a *javascript* web plotting tool.


## Projects
<a id ='demo'></a>
### Data Visualization 101 in Rshiny and `ggplot2`
The dataset is classic *Iris* dataset. Implement basic EDA on the dataset. (todo: may implememt different classification algorithm on the dataset)


<a id='R&D'></a>
### 1. R&D cost for different countries, differen years
First bite of R shiny! 

Try to:
- recap usage of R dataFrame
- use different Panels(tabs) in shiny
- `ggplot2` recap
